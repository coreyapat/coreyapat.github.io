    <p>I am married to one amazing woman, and I have an awesome daughter. With another one on the way!</p>
    <p>I am 24 years old, with a love for technology. I was in the navy for about 6 years before making the change of a
        better life for my family. I was bron in Tyler, Texas, and now live in Dallas, Texas, and hoping to grow my
        experiences with new and interesting things or ideas to better myself, as well as people around me.</p>
